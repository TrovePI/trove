A C++ package index for the bpt build system.

Trove is a package index that I use to store packages I've created using the DDS build System. It's mostly for personal use but is a open source and freely accessible archive that allows anyone to quickly and easily add packages to their project. Most of the libraries I build are (will) be available there.

Have a look at the [Wiki](https://github.com/oraqlle/trove/wiki) for details.

Package documentation comming soon.
