## Project Dependencies

In bpt, you're project can declare dependency on libraries from external packages. A dependency constist of the packages name, the range of accepted versions and libraries it uses. Dependencies are declared in the 'dependencies:' section of the `bpt.yaml` file.

<sup>Note<sup>1</sup>: Some packages don't contain libraries. In that case, the entire package is consider the library (e.g. below with 'fmt').</sup>

```yaml
# other package details above

dependencies:
  - fmt@8.1.1 # using fmt << Implicit
```

<sup>Note<sup>2</sup>: 'fmt' is part of bpt [default package](https://repo-3.bpt.pizza/) repo.</sup>

### Package Version Range

With bpt, you can specify the version range that you project accepts with different specifiers. Above you saw the `@` range specifier used, which indicates any version above the indicated one ('8.1.1' here) but below the next major version, i.e. [8.1.1, 9.0.0).

- `=1.2.3` - Indicates the exact version desired
- `~1.2.3` - Indicates the minimum version requirement and goes up to the next minor version change i.e. [1.2.3, 1.3.0)
- `^1.2.3` or `@1.2.3` - Indicates the minimum version requirement and goes up to the next major version change i.e. [1.2.3, 2.0.0)
- `+1.2.3` - Indicate the minumum version requirement and any higher version is acceptable

## Test Dependencies

Test dependencies are used exactly the same normal dependencies except they are not used by downstream users and they are declared in the 'test-dependencies:' section of the `bpt.yaml` file. Test dependencies are only used by files with the `*.test.cpp` extension i.e. they are only used for testing the project.

```yaml
# dependencies above

test-dependencies:
  - catch@2.13.9 using main
```

This allows use to have full access to catch2's testing facilities.

<sup>Note<sup>3</sup>: Notice the use of `using main` indicating we're using the 'main' library from catch2.</sup>

<sup>Note<sup>4</sup>: You still have to declare the header in the relevent files that use dependencies. Usually this follows th pattern of the package's/library's name and then the header name, e.g. `#include <catch2/catch.hpp>`</sup>
