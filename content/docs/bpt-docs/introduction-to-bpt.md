## Overview

bpt is a build and packaging tool for C and C++ projects and packages. It aims to be configurable, simplistic, modular and create reproducable builds. It was developed by [vector-of-bool](https://github.com/vector-of-bool), a C++ developer, blogger and librarian.

Currently, bpt is in its beta stage (1.0.0-beta-1 at the time of writing) and as such bpt and Trove for that matter are subject to change with time.

If you are familiar with [Cargo] from Rust, bpt will feel very similar. Unlike other build tools bpt focuses you on writing code, not build scripts and has a rigid project structure that allows code to be organised better and builds to be reproduced easily. More information on bpt's design can be found here. [bpt Design and Rational docs →](https://bpt.pizza/docs/latest/design.html)

This set of documentation gives a little more detail on how to use bpt. If you want a quick guide or refresher you can go back a page and view the _Quick Start_ guide for bpt and Trove.

bpt's offical documentation will always remain more up to date with the most recent bpt version. As such, refer to it if you have any issues using bpt and make an issue on _Trove's_ GitHub indicating that our documentation needs updating. Now onwards!
