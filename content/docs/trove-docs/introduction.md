## Using trovepi.dev

The website that Trove is hosted on aims to provide a friendly interface for viewing and seaching packages, learning how to use bpt and building your own packages to be published to Trove. Trove also has a search bar for finding packages, documentation and other resources to help on your development journey.

## An Overview

The [Docs](../../../docs/) section (as you've already seen) is home to any and all documentation regarding getting started with bpt, using Trove, developing projects and packages and finding new and exciting packages for your own build.

The [Packages](../../../packages/) section is the main section to view and search for packages and any and all infomation for those packages.

The [Blog](../../../blog/) section contains blog posts from me (oraqlle) regarding the development of Trove and the packaging/building progression of C++.
